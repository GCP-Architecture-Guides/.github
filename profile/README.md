# NATT Springboard - Program Description

# Purpose

The NATT Springboard is a new initiative designed to accelerate GCP adoption and consumption with pre-built design patterns, lightweight infrastructure as code, and operational baselines.

# Methods

During our many discussions with customers and CEs, we learn about product gaps and then develop solutions, in the forms of architectures and patterns, to be adopted by customers. 

Moving forward, these architectures and patterns will be published for other customers using guides and Terraform. The audience for these designs are  mostly security architects and engineers who want to try new cloud services and feature in a non-production sandbox. The architectures will be scoped and focused on a specific design or feature. Additionally, we will provide a baseline to help security engineers with the process of approving the new cloud service or feature by equipping them with operational guidance (e.g., instructions around logging queries, monitoring, alerting, and incident response).

To ensure the architectures and design patterns meet the requirements and expectations of customers, it is essential to gather feedback from them in the field. Customer feedback can provide valuable information on a variety of factors, such as usability, performance, security, and scalability. 

## Architectural Patterns and Guides

An architectural pattern is a reusable solution to a common architectural problem that has been proven to work well in multiple situations. It provides a set of options and design decisions for how to organize, integrate and configure services and features to achieve certain qualities such as security, maintainability, and reliability. Patterns can include multiple options.  
An architectural guide provides guidance on the architecture of a specific workload. It typically includes information on the system's overall structure, design principles, and practices to be used, as well guidelines for making architectural-related decisions. It can help to align the architecture with the business and technical goals of the system, ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and robust. Guides are opinionated and focus on one specific design.

# Architecture Lifecycle

Cloud architectures need to be reviewed and validated periodically to ensure they continue to meet the evolving needs of workloads and organizations. As technology and business requirements change, architectures that were once effective may become outdated or inefficient. Regular reviews and validations help to identify potential problems and areas for improvement, such as security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, or compliance issues. Thus, each architecture will have a predefined lifetime. If a cloud architecture is not reviewed and validated periodically, it will become obsolete and removed from the architecture repository.
